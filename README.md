# Portfolio Flash
Welcome to Portfolio Flash, our project for the hackathon HackYourPortfolio 2023!

Portfolio Flash is an app that generates portfolios in a flash! It is based on user input on both portfolio information and formatting choices, so all portfolios generated are fully customized and personal!

##Github Pages - https://yoda-flash.github.io/portfolio-flash/
Ideally, this github page acts as a landing site, which allows the Auth0 to authenticate the user before entering the actual app.

##Streamlit Page - https://yoda-flash-portfolio-flash-app-socrsu.streamlit.app/
Ideally, this streamlit page will take in user input, and after pressing a button, it will generate a PDF portfolio.
